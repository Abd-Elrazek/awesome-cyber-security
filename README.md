A collection of awesome software, libraries, documents, books, resources and cool stuff about security.

Inspired by [Awesome Security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security) and [Herman Slatman](https://github.com/hslatman).

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/fabionoth/awesome-cyber-security/graphs/contributors), you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! The goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.
